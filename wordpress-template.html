      <h2>About Project CYSTEM</h2>
      <p>
        Project CYSTEM is a women's health advocacy initiative dedicated to increasing
        awareness of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)—a condition affecting millions worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to educate communities with evidence-based information, advocate for
        better understanding and healthcare equity, and build a supportive, stigma-free space
        for individuals impacted by PCOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        PCOS is more than a diagnosis. It affects physical health, emotional well-being, and
        quality of life. Through compassion, education, and shared experiences, we aim to
        empower individuals to advocate for themselves and others.

     SECTION 4: WHY PCOS AWARENESS MATTERS
     Location: Additional Page
     ============================================ -->

<section class="cystem-awareness">
  <h2>Why PCOS Awareness Matters</h2>
  <p>
    PCOS is one of the most common endocrine conditions affecting women and individuals
    with ovaries, yet it remains widely misunderstood and underdiagnosed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raising awareness promotes earlier diagnosis, reduces stigma and misinformation,
    and improves access to care and support.
  </p>
  <p>
    Awareness leads to empowerment.
