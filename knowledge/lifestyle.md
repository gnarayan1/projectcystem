Lifestyle support often focuses on sustainable habits rather than short-term extremes.

Practical areas include:

- Balanced nutrition patterns
- Regular physical activity
- Sleep consistency
- Stress management

Even small, consistent changes can improve day-to-day symptoms and long-term risk markers.
