Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition that can affect reproductive, metabolic, and psychological health.

Symptoms and severity vary by person. Some people experience irregular cycles, acne, hair growth changes, or weight and insulin-related challenges.

PCOS is not just a fertility issue. It may be associated with long-term cardiometabolic risks, so early evaluation and regular follow-up are important.

Management is typically personalized and can include lifestyle support and clinician-guided treatment.
