Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation rather than a single test.

A clinician may review menstrual history, symptoms, physical exam findings, and lab or ultrasound results where appropriate.

Evaluation also often includes screening for conditions associated with PCOS, such as insulin resistance or lipid abnormalities.

Early diagnosis can help reduce delays in care and improve long-term health outcomes.
