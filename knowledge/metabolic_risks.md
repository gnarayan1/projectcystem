PCOS is often associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Long-term monitoring may include blood sugar markers, lipid panels, blood pressure, and other metabolic indicators.

Lifestyle interventions and medical follow-up can help reduce risk and support better long-term outcomes.
