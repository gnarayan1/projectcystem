        <h2>About Project CYSTEM</h2>
        <p>
          Project CYSTEM is a women's health advocacy initiative dedicated to increasing
          awareness of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)—a condition affecting millions worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to educate communities with evidence-based information, advocate for
          better understanding and healthcare equity, and build a supportive, stigma-free space
          for individuals impacted by PCOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          PCOS is more than a diagnosis. It affects physical health, emotional well-being, and
          quality of life. Through compassion, education, and shared experiences, we aim to
          empower individuals to advocate for themselves and others.

    <h2>Why PCOS Awareness Matters</h2>
    <p>
      PCOS is one of the most common endocrine conditions affecting women and individuals
      with ovaries, yet it remains widely misunderstood and underdiagnosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising awareness promotes earlier diagnosis, reduces stigma and misinformation,
      and improves access to care and support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awareness leads to empowerment.
    </p>
